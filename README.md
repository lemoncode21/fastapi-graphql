# FastAPI GraphQL CRUD Example
This repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with FastAPI and GraphQL. It demonstrates how to create a basic API for managing data using FastAPI's powerful features and GraphQL for querying and manipulating data.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (3.7 or higher)
Pip (Python package manager)

## Installing Dependencies
Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-graphql-crud.git`
`cd fastapi-graphql-crud`

Install the project dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Running the Application

- Start the FastAPI server 
- Open your web browser or use a tool like GraphiQL to interact with the GraphQL API. The GraphQL endpoint can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/graphql.


## Usage
You can use the GraphQL API to perform CRUD operations on the data. Refer to the GraphQL schema documentation for available queries and mutations.
